## Vision

Albert Rich is the author of 3 implementations of the muLisp artificial intelligence development system,
and coauthor of the muMath and Derive computer algebra systems.
However, his current research will be by far my most important and enduring contribution to the fields of math 
and computer science.

Since the beginning of recorded history, mathematicians have been amassing mathematical truths at an ever
greater rate and into ever more esoteric realms.
However, this vast amount of knowledge has not been systematically organized so the precise
formula required to solve a particular problem can easily be found.
It's like leaves scattered on a lawn, rather than organized into a heavily branched tree with each leaf attached to the
appropriate limb.
