# Instructions for Using Rubi

Loading the Mathematica implementation of Rubi defines an extensive system of rules capable of integrating large classes of mathematical expressions.  Although Rubi's **Int** commands are similar in form and function to Mathematicaâ€™s **Integrate** commands, the rules Rubi uses to integrate expressions do *not* in any way depend on Mathematica's built-in integrator.


## Loading Rubi

After the Rubi package has been properly installed as described in the [Rubi installation instructions](https://rulebasedintegration.org/downloadRubi.html), use the command
```mma
Get["Rubi`"]
```
or the shorter form
```mma
<<Rubi`
```
to load Rubi into Mathematica.

The first time Rubi is loaded, it will take a minute or two to read in and initialize the system.  However, this initial load also saves a fast loading memory image of Rubi, so all subsequent load commands will be almost instantaneous. 


## Integrating expressions

A Rubi command of the form **Int[*expn*, *var*]** integrates ***expn*** with respect to ***var***, and returns its antiderivative (also called its indefinite integral).  For example, the command
```mma
Int[x Sin[x]^2, x]
```
returns the antiderivative

<style> div.centertext {text-align: center;} </style>
<div class="centertext"> $$\frac{x^2}{4}+\frac{\sin ^2(x)}{4}-\frac{1}{2} x \sin (x) \cos (x)$$ </div>

A Rubi command of the form **Int[{*expn1*, *expn2*, ...}, *var*]** integrates ***expn1***, ***expn2***, ... each with respect to ***var***, and returns a list of their antiderivatives.  For example, the command
```mma
Int[Table[x^n, {n, 0, 5}], x]
```
returns the list

$$\left\{x,\frac{x^2}{2},\frac{x^3}{3},\frac{x^4}{4},\frac{x^5}{5},\frac{x^6}{6}\right\}$$

A Rubi command of the form **Int[*expn*, {*var*, *a*, *b*}]** integrates ***expn*** with respect to ***var***, and returns the limit of its antiderivative as ***var*** approaches ***b*** minus the limit as ***var*** approaches ***a***.  According to the *Fundamental Theorem of Calculus* (FTOC), this difference will equal the definite integral of ***expn*** from ***a*** to ***b*** *if and only if* the antiderivative is continuous between the two points.  For that reason, Rubi strives to return antiderivatives that are continuous on the real line to the maximum extent possible.

For example, the command
```mma
Int[x Sin[x]^2, {x, 0, Pi}]
```
returns $\frac{\pi ^2}{4}$ which equals the definite integral of $x \sin ^2(x)$ from 0 to pi, since the antiderivative is continuous over this interval.  However, the command
```mma
Int[1/(1-x^2), {x, 0, 2}]
```
returns arctanh(2) although $\frac{1}{1-x^2}$ does *not* converge over the interval {0,2}.


## Displaying integration steps

A Rubi command of the form **Steps[Int[*expn*, *var*]]** displays all the steps while integrating of ***expn*** with respect to ***var***, and returns its antiderivative.  For example, the command
```mma
Steps[Int[(a + b*Sqrt[x])^d, x]]
```
displays the steps

![steps](https://rulebasedintegration.org/RubiScreenShots/integrationSteps1.png)

and returns the antiderivative

$$\frac{2 \left(a+b \sqrt{x}\right)^{d+2}}{b^2 (d+2)}-\frac{2 a \left(a+b \sqrt{x}\right)^{d+1}}{b^2 (d+1)}$$

The boxes on the right are the integration formulas in red.  The boxes on the left are the intermediate results in blue.

Click on the triangle left of a formula to display the complete integration rule including its number and application conditions.  For example, clicking on the triangle left of the first formula above changes the display of integration steps to

![condition](https://rulebasedintegration.org/RubiScreenShots/integrationSteps2.png)

Click on an intermediate result to copy it to the clipboard so it can be entered as Mathematica input. The "Copy Steps" button copies the complete list of steps as raw Mathematica expressions as they were collected by Rubi.

A Rubi command of the form **Step[Int[*expn*, *var*]]** displays just the first step of the integration of ***expn*** with respect to ***var***, and returns the intermediate result.  Its display of the integration rule is the same as that used by the **Steps** command.


## Displaying integration statistics

A Rubi command of the form **Stats[Int[*expn*, *var*]]** integrates ***expn*** with respect to ***var***, and displays statistics about the integration before returning its antiderivative.  For example, the command

```mma
Stats[Int[(a + b*Sqrt[x])^d, x]]
```
displays

![Stats](https://rulebasedintegration.org/RubiScreenShots/integrationStats.png)

and returns the antiderivative

$$\frac{2 \left(a+b \sqrt{x}\right)^{d+2}}{b^2 (d+2)}-\frac{2 a \left(a+b \sqrt{x}\right)^{d+1}}{b^2 (d+1)}$$

The statistics provide the following information

- `"Steps"`: the number of steps used to integrate the expression.
- `"NumerOfRules`": the number of distinct rules used.
- `"InputLeafCount"`: the leaf count size of the input expression.
- `"OutputLeafCount"`: the leaf count size of the found antiderivative.
- `"Ratio"`: the rule-to-size ratio of the integration, i.e. the quotient of `"NumberOfRules"` and `"InputLeafCount"`.
- `"Rules"`: the rule-numbers of the distinct rules used.

The statistics include a measure of the difficulty integrating an expression based on the number of distinct rules divided the leaf count size of the expression. 

Each entry in the `Stats` can be accessed easily by either viewing the `InputForm` of the `Stats` ouput, or using accessor
like this

```mma
{stats, result} = Stats[Int[(a + b*Sqrt[x])^d, x]];
stats["Steps"]
stats["NumberOfRules"]
stats["InputLeafCount"]
stats["OutputLeafCount"]
stats["Ratio"]
stats["Rules"]
```


### Advanced inspection of the integration

If you want to inspect integration steps or the statistics as a normal Mathematica expression instead of printing them in a visually pleasing form, the `Steps`, `Step`, and `Stats` function take an option `RubiPrintInformation` that can be set to `False`. The information about the integration is then returned together with the antiderivative:

```mma
Steps[Int[x, x], RubiPrintInformation -> False]
```

![Steps as expression](http://i.stack.imgur.com/locjv.png)

The last integer in `RubiRule` corresponds to the index of the `Int`-*down value* which is in the above example

```mma
DownValues[Int][[30]]
```

### Internals

#### Global variables

For historical reasons, Rubi maintains 2 global settings that need to be set *before* you load the package if you want to change the behavior. Their default value is `True`. These variables were intended to decrease the loading time of the Rubi package. However, starting with Rubi version 4.16.0.4, Rubi will store its state in a binary format after the package is loaded the first time. Each subsequent calls to load Rubi will use the binary files instead and the package is usually loaded almost instantateously. The two global variables are:

```mma
$LoadShowSteps = True;
$LoadElementaryFunctionRules = True;
```

1. `$LoadShowSteps` needs to be `True` if you want to see the list of integration rules that Rubi uses to compute an
antiderivative.
2. `$LoadElementaryFunctionRules` needs to by `True` if you want to solve integrals that contain sine, tangents, exponentials, etc.

### Stuff for home page

The [Rubi Mathematica package](https://github.com/RuleBasedIntegration/Rubi) is the reference implementation
of the integration rules.
It provides an `Int[expr, var]` function that can, like Mathematica's `Integrate`, find the antiderivative of `expr` 
with respect to `var`. 
Further information about the Rubi package can be found here

1. The [complete and open-source package code](https://github.com/RuleBasedIntegration/Rubi) on GitHub. It includes the
source-notebooks that contain the integration rules and provides everything to build and use it as Mathematica package.
2. The [Wiki of this repository](https://github.com/RuleBasedIntegration/Rubi/wiki) which will soon contain detailed
information about Rubi's development process.
3. If you find a bug or an expression that Rubi cannot integrate, please use the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/RuleBasedIntegration/Rubi/issues)
and describe as clearly as possible what you have found.
