## Test-suite for Rubi

Contemporaneous with the development of Rubi, a test-suite consisting of tens of thousands of integration problems was built to test every aspect of the system. Each problem is stored as a list of the integrand, the integration variable, the number of steps Rubi uses to integrate the problem, and the optimal antiderivative. 

Since the resulting test-suite is useful for evaluating the performance of *any* symbolic integrator, the problems have been translated into the syntax of several popular computer algebra systems.  The test-suite files are freely available in the following formats:

- [Axiom integration test suite][1]
- [Maple integration test suite][2]
- [Mathematica integration test suite][3]
- [Maxima integation test suite][4]
