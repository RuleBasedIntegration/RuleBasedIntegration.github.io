## Welcome to Rubi, the page for Rule-based Integration

Rubi is an extensive system of symbolic integration rules that can be systematically applied to determine the antiderivative of a wide variety of mathematical expressions. Organized as a decision tree based on the form of the integrand, the 6600+ rules Rubi uses can be viewed in human-readable form or downloaded in machine-readable form.
