## About

The integration rules of Rubi were crafted by Albert Rich. However, many people have helped by either contributing knowledge, reporting bugs or testing Rubi. For this, a special thanks goes to David Jeffrey, Daniel Lichtblau, David Stoutemyer, Martin Welz, and Nasser M. Abbasi. In 2018, Patrick Scheibe suggested to make Rubi accassible to a wider audience by improving the Mathematica package and making source-code, rules, and Rubi performance tests available through the [Rule-based Integration GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/RuleBasedIntegration). Since then, he worked closely with Albert to improve Rubi.
